    "# CHANGES SINCE PREVIOUS BEST:\n",
    "# - implementation. Now with better abstraction! \n",
    "#     Should have no effect on performance, but dev much easier.\n",
    "# - training algo. Now using Adam instead of SBGD with Nesterov momentum \n",
    "#     mostly just faster convergence...)\n",
    "# - changed activation on conv2d layer to be a pRelu with all units fitted (previously vanilla Relu)\n",
    "# - changed activation on output to be leaky Relu with alpha=.3\n",
    "# - changed initialization on output and conv2d layers to be He with proper func instead of Glorot\n",
    "# - added a \"feature pool\" layer after conv2d. \n",
    "#     This was most impactful; improved performance by ~.05 and reduced overfitting"
